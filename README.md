    Ã∂  PyCharm IDE
    Ã∂  Streamlit
    Ã∂  NLTK
    Ã∂  XAMP
    Ã∂  GitHub 

#### Tools & Technologies: -

üîπ NLTK & Pyparser for NLP:
NLTK can be used for:
  Ã∂  Find text to analyse
  Ã∂  Pre-process your text for analysis
  Ã∂  Analyses your text
  Ã∂  Create visualizations based on your analysis
  
üîπ Streamlit for Backend:
Streamlit is special framework for handling the Data intensive 
applications, we are using it because it‚Äôs have amazing UI components, we 
don‚Äôt need to implement HTML+ CSS, everything will be handled by 
python code. It is very easy to use. In this deployment is also very easy.

üîπ PDFMiner for extracting PDF
PDFMiner, a Python library, to extract text from PDF files and perform 
text analysis.
PDFMiner attempts to reconstruct some of those structures by using 
heuristics on the positioning of characters. This works well for sentences 
and paragraphs because meaningful groups of nearby characters can be 
made.

üîπ Base64 for PDF displaying
Sometimes you have to send or output a PDF file within a text document 
(for example, HTML, JSON, XML), but you cannot do this because binary 
characters will damage the syntax of the text document. To prevent this, 
for example, you can encode PDF file to Base64 and embed it using the 
data URI.

üîπ Pillow:
Pillow also allows us to convert an image to a NumPy array. After converting 
an image to NumPy array we can read it in using PIL.

üîπ Numpy:
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than 
traditional Python lists.

üîπ Pycharm IDE:
PyCharm is professional IDE which is developed by JetBrains. The 
features which are offered by PyCharm Community version is Intelligent 
Python editor, Code debugger, Code inspection, VCS support and many 
more related to the User Interface. 

üîπ BS4 and requests for Web Scraping:
Using Beautiful Soup, you will have no problem scraping information from web 
pages. By layering Pythonic idioms on top of HTML or XML parsers, iterator,
search, and modification functions can be performed.

üîπ XAMP
It is open source control panel which is easy to use and maintain the 
apache, database, and PhpMyAdmin. It is very easy to operate. We can 
operate apache, MySQL easily from it. It is easily available for windows 
& windows & another platform

## Algorithms Design
STEP 1: GO TO SYSTEMS HOME PAGE

STEP 2: ASK USER TO UPLOAD THE RESUME.

STEP 3: IF IN PDF FORMAT THE GO FORWARD. 
ELSE THROUGH AN ERROR AND GO TO STEP 2

STEP 4: STORE IT IN SYSTEM.

STEP 5: PROCESS RESUME USING PDF2TEXT

STEP 6: PERFORM NLP PROCESSING

STEP 7: FETCH THE USER INFORMATION

STEP 8: PASS SKILL RECOMMENDATION. GENERATE SKILL 
RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON USER‚ÄôS SKILLS.

STEP 9: STORE USER DATA.

STEP 10: END

def pdf_reader(file):
    resource_manager = PDFResourceManager()
    fake_file_handle = io.StringIO()
    converter = TextConverter(resource_manager, fake_file_handle, laparams=LAParams())
    page_interpreter = PDFPageInterpreter(resource_manager, converter)
    with open(file, 'rb') as fh:
        for page in PDFPage.get_pages(fh,
                                        caching=True,
                                        check_extractable=True):
            page_interpreter.process_page(page)
            print(page)
        text = fake_file_handle.getvalue()

    # close open handles
    converter.close()
    fake_file_handle.close()
    return text

## ‚≠ê Recommender Code

def course_recommender(course_list):
    st.subheader("**Courses & Certificatesüéì Recommendations**")
    rec_course = []
    no_of_reco = st.slider('Choose Number of Course Recommendations:', 1, 10, 4)
    random.shuffle(course_list)
    for c_name, c_link in course_list:
        c += 1
        st.markdown(f"({c}) [{c_name}]({c_link})")
        rec_course.append(c_name)
        if c == no_of_reco:
            break
    return rec_course
